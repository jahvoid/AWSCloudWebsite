                <p>My nick name is JJ, I want to become a cloud architect some day. I enjoy playing Call of Duty when I don't have loads of assignments and I have three dogs Amira, Belle and Lio.</p>
                <p>I am passionate about cloud computing and technology innovation. Through this project, I gained hands on experience in configuring AWS EC2 instances, S3 buckets and deploying real world applications to the cloud</p>
